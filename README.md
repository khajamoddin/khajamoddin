# Khajamoddin Shaik

**Senior Systems Architect & AI Infrastructure Engineer**  
**Rust · Go · Performance Engineering · Distributed & Mission-Critical Systems**

I design and build **reliable, high-performance systems** where correctness, efficiency, and long-term maintainability matter.  
My work is grounded in **deep systems engineering**, with a growing focus on **AI infrastructure, agent runtimes, and cost-efficient inference**.

With 25+ years in enterprise and industrial environments, I am motivated by **hard problems**—especially those involving memory behavior, system limits, and performance under real-world constraints.

---

## Current Focus

- **Rust-first AI infrastructure** for safe, predictable, and efficient systems
- **LLM & agent runtimes** with attention to memory locality, scheduling, and cost
- **Performance & cost optimization research** across AI and enterprise platforms
- Bridging **legacy systems and modern AI workloads** responsibly

I am particularly interested in **AI systems that must run reliably at scale**, not demos.

---

## Research & Engineering Interests

- Memory management challenges in **Python, C++, and Java**
- Safe, high-performance alternatives using **Rust and Go**
- CPU-efficient inference and non-GPU-centric AI execution
- Agent orchestration, data pipelines, and decision systems
- Observability, failure modes, and operational correctness

If an enterprise or organization is facing **memory-related performance bottlenecks** on private platforms, I am open to conducting a **confidential case study** under **full NDA and privacy guarantees**—purely out of professional curiosity and a desire to learn, improve, and innovate.

- Linux internals · RHEL · Oracle Solaris
- Legacy & HPC environments
- Mainframe exposure (IBM Z ecosystems)

### Middleware & Integration (Deep Experience)
- IBM MQ · IIB / ACE · DataPower
- SOA · Messaging · Enterprise integration
- Mission-critical reliability engineering

> TypeScript and frontend technologies are **not** my primary focus.  
> My background is rooted in **systems, middleware, data integration, and analytics engineering**.

## Representative Work (Conceptual & Applied)

| Area | Description |
|----|----|
| AI Decision Systems | Industry benchmarking, anomaly detection, predictive analytics |
| Agent Runtimes | Multi-agent coordination with performance and cost awareness |
| ESNODE Runtime (Concept) | CPU-first, hardware-agnostic LLM inference |
| Enterprise Optimization | Memory & throughput analysis for large platforms |

---

## Industry Experience

I have worked across environments where **failure is not an option**:

- **Banking & Finance**
- **Manufacturing & Industrial Systems**
- **Airlines**
- **Defence & Government (Military Systems)**
- **Telecommunications**
- **Power Generation & Utilities**

These domains shaped my bias toward **robustness, observability, and correctness over novelty**.

---

## Professional Philosophy

I enjoy:
- Mission-critical systems
- Deep problem-solving
- Understanding *why* systems fail—not just how to fix them
- Building software that engineers can trust years later

I value **quiet reliability over hype**, and **engineering discipline over trends**.
